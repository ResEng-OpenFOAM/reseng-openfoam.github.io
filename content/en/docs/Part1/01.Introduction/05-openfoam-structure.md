  Get familiarized with the most important OpenFOAM installation files and

The Docker container we created and got familiarized with in the first unit
of this module had a recent OpenFOAM version already installed.

Now it's time to dig into OpenFOAM installation files.


## OpenFOAM Installation directory

Depending on what **users** you want to have access to OpenFOAM, one can
perform:

- A System-wide install: where all users have access to OpenFOAM's solvers and
  utilities. This is done by installing to a system location
  (eg. `/opt/openfoam8` for OpenFOAM v8)
  - This is the approach I used to install OpenFOAM in the container (See 
  `/opt/OpenFOAM-dev`)

- A User-specific install: where only one user will have access to OpenFOAM
  binaries. Usually, the user will winstall it under his home directory
  ($HOME/OpenFOAM`)

To discover where OpenFOAM is installed on your system:
```bash
(of@con:run) echo $FOAM_INST_DIR
```

{{% alert title="Example" color="success" %}}
If we were to install OpenFOAM v8 as the user `of`, the installation files would
go to `/home/of/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-8`.

And the `FOAM_INST_DIR` environment variable will say: `/home/of/OpenFOAM`.

This way, we can also install additional versions (and forks) if we need to.
{{% /alert %}}

No matter how the software installed, if a users use it, they will have
some files in their $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-<VERSION>`; where `<VERSION>` is
the version number of the software.

> Because the container has the latest(-ish) development version of OpenFOAM,
> the "version number" will actually say `dev`, so the mentioned directory
> would expand to `/home/of/OpenFOAM/of-dev`

## OpenFOAM directories

The installation comes with the following directories (the diagram 
attempts to give a brief "usage" summary for each directory; you'll pick it up
as you go):

If we were to install OpenFOAM v8 as the user `of`, the installation files would
go to `/home/of/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-8`.

And the `FOAM_INST_DIR` environment variable will say: `/home/of/OpenFOAM`.

This way, we can also install additional versions (and forks) if we need to.

## The tutorials directory

The tutorials directory is extremely useful when:

- You want to start new cases.
  - Just copy over the most similar (to your problem) tutorial case and start
    adjusting ...
- You're confused about a keyword.
  - Eg. Want to find out what NS is preferred for a specific solver? Just
    cross-search tutorial dictionaries for matches (You'll learn how to that
    later)
- You want to find out which solvers may be suited for your problem
  - A tutorial case may be compatible with many solvers;
  - Find the closest case to your problem, and you'll find the appropriate
    solvers you need to run.


### Now what?

This unit is not associated with an assignment; you can continue 
to the next one immediately.
